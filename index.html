                <h1>His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</h1>
                <img src="img/sp11.jpg" alt="">
                <p>His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first
                    met
                    his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta
                    Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four branches of Gaudiya Mathas
                    (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching
                    Vedic knowledge in the Western world. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later
                    (1933)
                    at Allahabad, he became his formally initiated disciple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada
                    to
                    broadcast Vedic knowledge through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada
                    wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita and in 1944, without assistance, started an English
                    fortnightly
                    magazine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing Srila Prabhupada‚Äôs philosophical learning and devotion, the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society
                    honored
                    him in 1947 with the title ‚ÄúBhaktivedanta.‚Äù In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
                    retired
                    from married life, and four years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more
                    time
                    to his studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived
                    in
                    very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of Radha-Damodara.
                    There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He accepted the renounced order of
                    life
                    (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life‚Äôs masterpiece: a
                    multivolume translation and commentary on the 18,000-verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He
                    also
                    wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the United States, in 1965,
                    to
                    fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over
                    sixty
                    volumes of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and
                    religious classics of India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada was practically
                    penniless. It was after almost a year of great difficulty that he established the International
                    Society
                    for Krishna Consciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has grew within a
                    decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and
                    farm
                    communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental Vedic community in the hills of
                    West
                    Virginia. Inspired by the success of New Vrndavana, then a thriving farm community of more than one
                    thousand acres, his students founded several similar communities in the United States and abroad.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and secondary education in the West
                    by
                    founding the Gurukula school in Dallas, Texas. The school began with three children in 1972, and by
                    the
                    beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to one hundred fifty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Srila Prabhupada also inspired the construction of a large international center at Sridhama Mayapur
                    in
                    West Bengal, India, which is also the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar
                    project
                    is the magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in Vrndavana, India. These
                    are
                    centers where Westerners can live to gain firsthand experience of Vedic culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Srila Prabhupada‚Äôs most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly respected by the
                    academic community for their authoritativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard
                    textbooks
                    in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven languages. The
                    Bhaktivedanta
                    Book Trust, established in 1972 exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus
                    become
                    the world‚Äôs largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and philosophy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the last ten years of his life, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe
                    twelve times on lecture tours that have took him to six continents. In spite of such a vigorous
                    schedule, Srila Prabhupada continued to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable
                    library
                    of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Srila Prabhupada left us a veritable library of Vedic philosophy and culture. Highly respected by
                    scholars for their authority, depth, and clarity, his books are used at colleges and universities
                    around
                    the world.</p>
