                <p>Bhaktivedanta Academy For Culture And Education is an institution dedicated to illuminating society through spiritual education along with their Collage Studies. We aim to educate leaders for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s movement for the respiritualization of humanity, which is meant to effect a change in the entire course of human history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to provide a facility for the Academy’s members to study, practice, and disseminate the teachings of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, along with Collage studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our educational program is designed to give students the opportunity to grow to their highest potential — academically socially, emotionally, and physically — all the while developing their spiritual identities in a nurturing and positive environment
